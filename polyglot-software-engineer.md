# Polyglot software Developer

The Rackspace Developer relations group is looking for a Developer with skills in
more than one programming language (such as PHP, Python, Ruby, Go Javascript)
ready to help us build to help lead, grow and build our Developer Experience
and solutions.

The Rackspace Developer Experience team is dedicated to making the cloud
platform end-to-end experience for developers, technologists, and all
customers, the best experience it can be.

We specialize in community outreach, documentation, client tools and SDKs.
We are on the front lines, engaging with our developers and helping them
build modern cloud applications, setting technical strategy for content,
tools, ecosystems and more. Our team is here to not only ship one product,
but to change the end-to-end experience from support, to content, tools and offerings.

The team operates on the bleeding edge - from containers, to emerging tools,
techniques and other technologies this is a chance to make a strategic impact
not just to one team and company - but for the wider developer community!

You will be working in a distributed team, so strong communication skills
and teamwork is a requirement. Remote workers are fully supported. We aren't
fussy about particular technology experience - we'd rather pick somebody
who can contribute interesting ideas, take bold technical leaps, is willing
to learn, and shows determination and acumen.

See our [Developer Portal](https://developer.rackspace.com) for more information
on our tools, SDKs and other work.
